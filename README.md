# Weather

The weather app is a simple application that allows users to enter a location and retrieves information about the current weather conditions for that location. The app uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the weather data. The application consists of an HTML file, a CSS file, and a JavaScript file. The HTML file contains the structure and layout of the application, including a form for entering the location and a div element to display the weather information. The CSS file is used to style the application and make it visually appealing. The JavaScript file contains the code that handles the user input and retrieves the weather data using the fetch API and OpenWeatherMap API.

The app, once the user input the location, sends a request to OpenWeatherMap API with the location and a secret key, the API then responds back with the weather information for that location, the JavaScript then process the response, and displays the weather information on the HTML page.
